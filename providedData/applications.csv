During the texturing process, the rollers are continuously rotated in an electrolysis bath and their surfaces are processed by means of electrodes (30 electrodes in a row). <br /> Alignment is important because distance between each of the individual electrodes and the roller must be identical in order to achieve a uniform surface structure. <br /> <br /> <strong>This process is automated in order to assure quick and accurate positioning of the rollers. <br /> - The position of the roller is measured at both roller ends by means of a DNCI with integrated displacement encoder. <br /> - Measured values are evaluated by a CPX terminal with CMIX displacement measuring module and are forwarded to the control computer. <br /> </strong>The actual value is then compared with the setpoint which has been entered to the system (depending upon roller type), and the position of the hydraulically powered roller mount (prism) is corrected – accurate to two hundredths of a mm. <br /> <br /> <strong>Energy saving procedure: <br /> </strong>- Thanks to its vertical mounting orientation (lowering of the piston rod under its own weight), the cylinder can be operated without pressure. <br /> - The cylinder is only operated pneumatically in order to return it to its initial position.;- CPX-CMIX-M1-1 <br /> - Positioning system <br /> - Displacement encoder<br /> - End-positioning of tool / pieces;2011;Public;BENDING, FOLDING AND STRAIGHTENING MACHINES  (INCL.
